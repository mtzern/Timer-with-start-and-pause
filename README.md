# Application Overview
This is simple little timer application when a user visits our application site the browser we're going to show them a number like 30 right there a play button and a pause button whenever the user clicks on play. We're then going to count this timer down. So in this case it starts at 30 seconds after one second we'll go down to twenty nine then 28 27 and so on until he eventually gets all the way down to zero as that timer is counting down.
A user can posit at any time by clicking on the pause button right there and then resume it by clicking
on play again.
